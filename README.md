== Description ==

This plugin allows integration of Gravity Forms with Genoo - so that form submits create leads within the Genoo system and store the data captured inside your Genoo applicaiton.  Then you can leverage smart rules (automation) to ensure appropriate actions are taken.  In addition, tracking of actions and behavior will be tracked to the lead record, and other plugins available from Genoo, can also be leveraged, including our Automated Segmentation plugin -- that will segment your leads based upon their behavior and engagement with your blog posts.
